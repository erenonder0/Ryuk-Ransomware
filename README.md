# Ryuk Ransomware
This project is an **academic simulation** designed to technically demonstrate and analyze how ransomware operates. Developed in C#, this application encrypts files in specific folders using the AES algorithm, creates a ransom note on the desktop, and, if no action is taken within a certain time frame, permanently deletes the files. **It is strictly prohibited to use this on real systems.**

## Features

- Ransomware simulation developed in C#
- Encrypts files in specified folders using AES
- Adds itself to system startup
- Configurable for Desktop, Pictures, and Documents folder encryption
- Provides a simple user interface
